# Spotify_Prediction_Algo
Different classification algorithms that predict the popularity of a song on Spotify given it's various musical attributes including both categorial and numerical predictors. Spotify data was obtained through Kaggle, a data analysis platform where users can collaborate, share, and work on data-related projects. The response variable is "Popularity" was converted to a categorial variable. Originally it was measured as a numerical variable (on a scale from 0-100).

Multiclass Classification Algorithms developed in this project: Linear Discriminant Analysis, Ordinal Regression, Trees, Pruned Tree, & Support Vector Machines.

Binary Classification Algorithms developed in this project: Lasso Penalizer, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Logistic Regression, & Ridge Penalizer.

Prediction accuracy was obtained through cross validation at a 80/20 train-test split, and error rates are visualized through base RStudio boxplots. Please note that conclusions cannot be extended beyond this sample.
